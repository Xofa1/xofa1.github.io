                <p class="description"> For a university course project, the goal was to create and integrate music and sound into an existing level of the game <i>Cube</i>. <i>Cube</i> is a first-person shooter developed by Audiokinetic, designed to allow people to experiment with their audio software Wwise.  Students were required to compose two music tracks and could use either self-recorded sounds or license-free sounds from the internet.  </p>

                <p> This is my first attempt at creating my own music tracks. To start, I had to come up with a melody. I tried different options and listened to them until I was satisfied. The first track was intended to be a mood-setting track,  designed to should put the player in a specific mood, such as happy, sad, scary or exciting. I opted for a cheerful and fun melody. I intentionally disregarded the fact that the game is a gritty first-person shooter, similar to classic titles such as Doom or Quake. To create a complete track from the melody, you need to add a harmony. My harmony consisted of chords that used the melody's notes as base notes. Both the melody and harmony are played by piano.  To support the sound I added a drum kit playing a simple 4/4 beat, as well as a shakuhachi flute and a synthesized harmonic string lead sound. The introduction and interruption of the various instruments provide variety and make the track less monotonous when repeated several times during playing the game. <br> </br> After completing the mood track, I began working on the battle track. This track was intended to play during battle scenes and provide excitement. To ensure a smooth transition between tracks, I used the chords from the harmony of the mood track as the foundation for the battle track. To accommodate the faster gameplay, I set the tempo to 170 beats per minute, compared to the 120 BPM of the mood track. The battle track should maintain a cheerful and exciting tone, conveyed through an electric guitar melody accompanied by drums and bass. The track is broken up by a small guitar solo in the middle and a break in the drums towards the end. </p>
